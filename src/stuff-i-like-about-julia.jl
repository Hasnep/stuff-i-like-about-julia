# > Julia's unofficial tagline is "Looks like Python, feels like Lisp, runs like Fortran."
# > I've been learning Julia for slightly less than a year now, and I'd like to share some of the things I've enjoyed about it.
# > I'll give an overview of the language's main features with code examples and discuss whether it really is the future scientific computing.

# Technically:
# > Julia is a high level, JIT compiled, dynamic language designed with multiple dispatch, automatic differentiation and metaprogramming.

# In practice:
# > Julia finds a balance between being fast and easy to use with lots of features you'll miss when you use another language.

# ## History

# - Julia was started in 2009 by Jeff Bezanson, Stefan Karpinski, Viral B. Shah, and Alan Edelman
# - Announced in 2012
# - Version 1.0 was released in 2018
# - Now on version 1.4, heading for 1.5 soon

# ## Julia is easy to use

# Let's write a function from scratch to sum an array of numbers, first in Python:
# ```python
# def my_sum(array):
#     """
#     Sum a list.
#     """
#     total = 0
#     for x in array:
#         total += x
#     return total
# ```

# Then in Julia:

"""
Sum an array.
"""
function my_sum(array)
    total = 0
    for x in array
        total += x
    end
    return total
end

# This syntax will be familliar if you've used Python.
    
my_sum(1:10)

# Benchmarks for this function in different languages:
# - C: ~10ms
# - Python: ~500ms
# - Julia: ~10ms

# ## It's fast

# Julia was designed to solve the "two language problem", where researchers use a slower, high-level language for research and then have to use a slower, low-level language once they hit a bottleneck or for production.
# Julia is both languages at the same time!

# Some benchmarks (from the Julia website) of different languages relative to C.
# ![Benchmarks of different languages relative to C](https://julialang.org/assets/benchmarks/benchmarks.svg)
# > Source: https://julialang.org/benchmarks/

# These benchmarks try to compare implementations of the same algorithm.
# Julia is comparable to compiled languages like Rust, Go, Fortran, etc. and is sometimes faster than C.
# Python is sometimes 100x slower than C.
# R is a bit slower than that.

# How is it so fast?

# Generally languages fall into two categories:

# - Compiled languages like C or Rust compile all the code before you run
# - Interpreted languages like Python or R don't compile

# Julia uses a _Just-In-Time_ (JIT) compiler which compiles a function the first time it is called.

# In my opinion, speed doesn't matter all that much

# - JIT compilation takes a short while
# - My time is more valuable than the computer's time

# Now, back to some code!

# ## Dynamically typed

# Let's write a function to calculate the $n$th Fibonacci number.
# We want the input `n` to only allow integers and we want to specify the output should only be integers.

"""
Calculate the nth Fibonacci number.
"""
function fib(n::Integer)::Integer
    if n < 2
        return n
    else
        return fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2)
    end
end

# If we try to run the function with a non-integer input

# ```julia
# julia> fib(0.5)
# ```

# Julia will throw an error:

# ```
# ERROR: MethodError: no method matching fib(::Float64)
# Closest candidates are:
#   fib(::Integer)
# ```

fib(20)

# There is also a one-line function notation that is useful for short functions

short_fib(n::Integer)::Integer = n < 2 ? n : short_fib(n - 1) + short_fib(n - 2)

short_fib(20)

# ## It's free!

# Julia is MIT licenced.

# ## Broadcasting

# In Python, most functions accept one element.
# Running this code:
# ```python
# >>> import math
# >>> math.sin([1, 2, 3])
# ```
# will give this error:
# ```
# TypeError: must be real number, not list
# ```
# Pythonistas would probably use a list comprehension:
# ```python
# >>> [math.sin(x) for x in [1, 2, 3]]
# ```
# or a map:
# ```python
# >>> map(math.sin, [1, 2, 3])
# ```
# ```
# [0.8414709848078965, 0.9092974268256817, 0.1411200080598672]
# ```

# In R, most functions are vectorised
# ```R
# > sin(c(1, 2, 3))
# ```
# ```
# [1] 0.8414710 0.9092974 0.1411200
# ```

# In Julia, functions are not vectorised, for example, this line:
# ```julia
# julia> sin([1, 2, 3])
# ```
# gives this error:
# ```
# ERROR: MethodError: no method matching sin(::Array{Int64,1})
# ```

# Using the broadcast operator, the funciton is applied elementwise!

sin.([1, 2, 3])

# Broadcasting even works for user functions
    
fib.(1:10)

# And for operators:

## What are the first 10 square numbers?
(1:10).^2

# This is powerful, but sometimes tricky syntax.
# For example, adding a dot makes the length function broadcast over the array:

length(split("How many words are in this sentence?"))
# +
length.(split("How many characters are each of these words?"))

# ## Useful Unicode characters

# Julia lets you type lots of symbols using LaTeX-y abbreviations, e.g. type `\alpha` and press tab for Œ± or `\sqrt` and tab for ‚àö.

Œ± = 37

# The square root symbol is an abbreviation for the `sqrt()` function:

‚àöŒ±

# Some constants like œÄ for pi and ‚ÑØ for Euler's constant are predefined:

## Use the approximate equals sign ‚âà because this calculation is not exact
‚ÑØ^(im * œÄ) ‚âà -1
    
# You can define your own operators using either built in functions:

const ‚äÇ = issubset
[2, 5] ‚äÇ [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# or user functions:

const ‚àë = my_sum
‚àë(1:10)

# Because Julia supports almost any symbol you can type as a variable name, that includes emojis!

üî• = 10
üê∂ = 20
üå≠ = 30
üî• + üê∂ == üå≠

# ## Julia is (mostly) written in Julia

# If you can read Julia code, you can also read Julia's source code to understand what it does.
# I looked at the most recent PR as an example:

tensor(A::AbstractArray, B::AbstractArray) = [a * b for a in A, b in B]
const ‚äó = tensor
#-
[1, 2] ‚äó [3, 4, 5]

# Python's numpy is fast because it's mostly written in C/C++ (51.4%), but if you want to do something that numpy can't do, you need to either use C++ or write slower Python code.

# This bridges the gap between a Julia user and a Julia developer.
# For every user of Julia, there's another possible contributer.

# ## Multiple dispatch

# As an example, let's build a small Julia package based on [Measurements.jl](https://github.com/JuliaPhysics/Measurements.jl/).

"""

"""
struct Uncertain <: Real

    err::Real
end

# Define the standard gravity on earth.

g = Uncertain(9.8, 0.1)

# Wouldn't it be nicer to show an uncertain number with the plus/minus symbol?
# Let's write a show function that dispatches on the Uncertain type:

Base.show(io::IO, x::Uncertain) = print(io, "$(x.val) ‚àì $(x.err)")

g

# Let's define the plus/minus operator to create `Uncertain` numbers:

‚àì(a::Real, b::Real) = Uncertain(a, b)

# How do you add two uncertain measurements?

my_brothers_height = 175 ‚àì 2

# ```julia
# julia> my_height + my_brothers_height
# ```
# ```
# ERROR: + not defined for Uncertain

# $$
# Q = a + b \\
# {\delta Q} = \sqrt{(\delta a)^2 + (\delta b)^2}
# $$

Base.:+(a::Uncertain, b::Uncertain) = (a.val + b.val) ‚àì sqrt(a.err^2 + b.err^2)
my_height + my_brothers_height

# Similar for subtraction.

Base.:-(a::Uncertain, b::Uncertain) = (a.val - b.val) ‚àì sqrt(a.err^2 + b.err^2)

# Slightly more complicated for multiplcation and division.

    total_error = total_value * sqrt((a.err / a.val)^2 + (b.err / b.val)^2)
    return Uncertain(total_value, total_error)
end

function Base.:/(a::Uncertain, b::Uncertain) 
    total_value = a.val / b.val
    total_error = total_value * sqrt((a.err / a.val)^2 + (b.err / b.val)^2)
    return Uncertain(total_value, total_error)
end
#-
my_height * my_brothers_height
#-
my_height / my_brothers_height

# Finally powers, again the exact formula is not important.

Base.:^(a::Uncertain, b::Real) = (a.val^b) ‚àì (abs(b) * a.val^(b - 1) * a.err)
my_height^2.0

# Finally, we need to tell Julia what to do if we give it an `Uncertain` number and some other number in the same operation.

# ```julia
# julia> 1 + g
# ```
# ```
# ERROR: promotion of types Int64 and Uncertain failed to change any arguments
# ```

# We want to convert both numbers to our `Uncertain` type:

Base.promote_rule(::Type{Uncertain}, ::Type{T}) where T <: Real = Uncertain

# Coverting a real number to our Uncertain type just means we add an error of 0: 

Base.convert(::Type{Uncertain}, x::Real) = Uncertain(x, 0)

# When Julia wants to convert an Uncertain number it doesn't need to do anything :

Base.convert(::Type{Uncertain}, x::Uncertain) = x
#-
1 + g

# Now we can solve a simple problem, how much time would it take if I dropped a ball from my height and my brother caught it at his height?

# Solve for t:
# $$
# t = \frac{\sqrt{2 a s + u^2} - u}{a} = \frac{\sqrt{2 g (h_1 - h_2)}}{g}
# $$

t = ((2 * g * (my_height - my_brothers_height))^0.5) / g

# Let's use the actual Measurements.jl package

using Measurements: Measurement, ¬±

# Let's solve the same problem as before and make sure we get the same result:

g = 9.8 ¬± 0.1
my_height = 190 ¬± 1
my_brothers_height = 175 ¬± 2

t = (2 * g * (my_height - my_brothers_height))^0.5 / g

# This next part is inspired by a JuliaCon talk called [_The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Multiple Dispatch_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kc9HwsxE1OY) by one of the Julia co-founders, Stefan Karpinski.

# All the "methods" are outside the class definition, that can include being in a completely different package.

# Let's solve the same problem using differential equations!

# Calculate the position of the ball between time $t = 0$ and $t = 3$
# $$
# v = \frac{ds}{dt}
# $$
# $$
# f(t) = -g t = - (9.8 \pm 0.1) t
# $$
# With initial conditions $s_0 = 190 \pm 1$

# ## Interoperability

# We can import any python module using the PyCall package:

using PyCall
#-

#-

# We can mix Python functions and variables with Julia code:

math.sin.([œÄ,  math.pi, 2œÄ,    2 * math.pi])

# We can define Python functions that call Julia funcitons
