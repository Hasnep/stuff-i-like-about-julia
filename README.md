> Julia's unofficial tagline is "Looks like Python, feels like Lisp, runs like Fortran."
> I've been learning Julia for slightly less than a year now, and I'd like to share some of the things I've enjoyed about it.
> I'll give an overview of the language's main features with code examples and discuss whether it really is the future scientific computing.
